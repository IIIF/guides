This is a brief guide to finding IIIF Manifest URLs from members of the IIIF community.  These guides begin from a record page, so do not include how to search or view an individual record.

Once you have a manifest URL you can use the [How to use IIIF Resources and Viewers]({{ site.guides_url | absolute_url }}/using_iiif_resources/) guide to open it in one of the many IIIF Viewers. 

This site is a work in progress, and heavily inspired by the initial work done by St Andrew's University to compile the initial [IIIF Resources List](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/assets/university/library/documents/IIF%20resources.pdf).

"Copy this link" is the final step in many of the guides and this involves right-clicking and "copy link address" or similar. Alternatively left click to open the link, then copy the address in the address bar.

## Collections
<ul>
  {% assign locations = site.pages %}
  {% assign sorted = locations | sort_natural: "title" %}
  {% for file in sorted %}
    {% if file.path contains 'guides' and file.name != 'template.md' and file.visible != false %}
      <li>
        <a href="{{ site.guides_url | append: file.url |  absolute_url}}">{{ file.title }}</a>
      </li>
    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
